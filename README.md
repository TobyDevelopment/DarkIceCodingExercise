# DarkIceCodingExercise
Had some free time so decided to reacquaint myself with Xamarin.  Took roughly 2-3 hours.
* All features are implemented
* Only tested on Android 10 (Samsung Note 10)
* Images are cached and cache is cleared when app is loaded so that images are updated
* List loads before images currently
* There are two contributers because one is my university github account
